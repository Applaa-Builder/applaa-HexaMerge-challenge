# AI Agents & Mock Data Documentation

This document outlines all AI agents used in the Obstacle 2048 game, their current implementation status, and plans for future enhancements.

## AI Agents

### Game AI Opponent

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| ‚úÖ Balanced Betty | Done | Default AI that balances risk and reward. Uses a medium-depth search algorithm to evaluate moves. |
| ‚úÖ Cautious Carl | Done | Conservative AI that prioritizes safe moves and corner strategies. Avoids risky merges. |
| ‚úÖ Risky Rachel | Done | Aggressive AI that prioritizes high-value merges and takes chances. May make suboptimal moves for potential big gains. |
| ‚úÖ Corner Connie | Done | AI that focuses on keeping high-value tiles in corners. Uses edge-building strategies. |
| ‚úÖ Merge Master | Done | AI that prioritizes creating merge opportunities. Focuses on maintaining an orderly grid. |
| üöß Adaptive AI | In Progress | AI that learns from player strategies and adapts difficulty based on player skill level. |
| ‚è≥ Expert Mode | Pending | Advanced AI using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for optimal play. |

### Implementation Details

The AI opponents are implemented in `utils/aiLogic.ts` using different evaluation functions for each persona:

```typescript
export function makeAIMove(
  grid: (Tile | null)[][],
  obstacles: Obstacle[],
  score: number,
  persona: AIPersona,
  gridSize: number
) {
  // Different evaluation strategies based on persona
  // Returns the best move direction
}
```

## Mock Data

### Game Levels

Currently using mock level data in `constants/game.ts`:

```typescript
export const LEVELS = [
  {
    name: 'Beginner',
    description: 'Classic 2048 - Merge tiles to reach 512',
    gridSize: 4,
    winningValue: 512,
    obstacles: []
  },
  // More levels...
]
```

### Achievements

Currently using mock achievements that are generated at runtime.

### User Stats

Currently using mock user statistics stored in local SQLite database.

## Conversion to Real Data

### Backend Integration Plan

1. **Game Levels & Obstacles**
   - Create a levels collection in database
   - Add admin interface for level creation and editing
   - Implement level downloading and caching for offline play
   - Add level ratings and community feedback

2. **User Authentication**
   - Implement user registration and login
   - Add social login options (Google, Apple, Facebook)
   - Create user profiles with avatars and stats

3. **Leaderboards & Social**
   - Global and friend leaderboards
   - Challenge system between players
   - Social sharing with deep links to specific levels

4. **Analytics & Telemetry**
   - Track game sessions, moves, and outcomes
   - Analyze popular levels and difficulty curves
   - Use data to improve AI behavior and level design

5. **Cloud Sync**
   - Sync game progress across devices
   - Backup and restore functionality
   - Offline-first approach with conflict resolution

## AI Enhancement Roadmap

1. **Improved Evaluation Functions**
   - Add positional weighting for different AI personas
   - Implement look-ahead for multiple moves
   - Add randomness factor for more human-like play

2. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - Train models on player data to predict optimal moves
   - Personalize AI difficulty based on player skill
   - Implement reinforcement learning for continuous improvement

3. **Contextual Hints**
   - AI-powered hint system for new players
   - Strategy suggestions based on current board state
   - Post-game analysis of player moves
